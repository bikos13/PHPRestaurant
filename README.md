- This project implements HTML5, CSS3, BOOTSTRAP, JAVASCRIPT, JQUERY, PHP7, MySQL (with mysqli methods)
- The Web App uses the plugin php-store-hours by coryetzkorn (Plugin on GitHub: https://github.com/coryetzkorn/php-store-hours) to provide realtime information about the open hours of the restaurant

2) Web App Usage:

a) Database Configuration

in phpmyadmin execute the script included in restaurant_db.sql
funtions/dbcon.php has 2 variables that should be changed according to usage<br>
$username = "root"; // default is root, change it on your servers username<br>
$password = ""; // default is empty, change it on your servers password<br>

b) Food Catalogue

This project has only 2 predefined food categories (Meat and Salads)
It is being populated by the file includes/arrays.php so if your want to add or alter dishes

Example (includes/arrays.php):
"foodCategory" => "Meat", // or Salad if you wish
        "foodTitle" => "35 OZ. TOMAHAWK RIBEYE", // Food Title
        "foodImageSlug" => "tomahawk-ribeye-specials.jpg", //image being pulled from ./img/menuItems/ **Reccommended thumbnail size 320x180**
        "foodDescription" => "This massive, tender, juicy ribeye ...", // Make sure Description have around the same character length to avoid styling problems
        "foodPrice" => "50" // Price
        
In Addition, use the currency symbol of your liking at functions/foodCataloging.php Line 35 (Instructions included in file).
